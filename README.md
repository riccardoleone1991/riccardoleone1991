## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m currently a PhD Student in the Computational Neurology Lab at the Ruhr University Bochum/University of Bonn under the supervision of Prof. Xenia Kobeleva. You can find code for my PhD publications [here](https://github.com/computational-neurology)
- ðŸ¥… My current project involves creating realistic models of whole-brain functional activity (e.g., fMRI) to personalize trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment for patients with Alzheimer's Disease. 
- ðŸ©º I previously obtained my M.D. Degree and License of Specialization in Radiology at UniversitÃ  Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan. My thesis was on machine learning algorithm to differentiate true progression from pseudoprogression in patients with glioblastoma treated with chemo-radiotherapy
